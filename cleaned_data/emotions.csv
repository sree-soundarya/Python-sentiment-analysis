I have tried a variety of skin care products and this is the only one that can balance the oils on my face. It helps heal breakouts and prevent new ones; and is the only product that helps with my acne. This product is also great for mild to severe sunburns; apply generously to affected area and you will feel the cooling effect immediately. Regular application(twice/ thrice a day) to sunburnt area helps heal the burn and peeling skin. The ingredients separate easily because it is a combination of clays and glycerin, so make sure you shake the bottle well before each use to ensure smooth application.

The product is good for 5 years from the date at the bottom of the bottle (date of manufacturing) . E.g., if the date is Aug 16 (2016), then your bottle of the lotion is good until Aug 21(2021).

Hi Everyone, I wanna tell you smells AWESOME, I am not one to buy a perfume over the internet that I am not familiar with, but I was willing to take a chance with this, I mean come on Jenna Jameson, I thought hmmm no way I could go wrong, right.

I'm a complete perfume addict, and since I don't go out of the house but prefer to shop online, I buy a lot of fragrances ""blind"", using only the reviews to predict whether I'll like a scent or not.  I decided to try this gem due to the extremely good price as well as all of the many positive reviews it has received.  My bottle arrived months ago, and I've really been LOVING this, especially in the Fall and Winter months (although I feel it is suitable no matter the season).  Until my obsession for perfumes really bloomed, which was relatively recently, I had mostly stuck to my two favorite scents (Ralph Lauren Safari and Elizabeth Arden Red Door).  Amongst all of the new fragrances I've added to my collection since then, this is one of my favorites.  Just a delicious, warm, comforting scent. I personally feel that this is a very sexy scent, but it is also a scent I enjoy wearing while just lounging around the house in pajamas, reading or binge-watching a TV show.  When I tried this perfume, on my first spray I got a heavy alcohol smell. Don't give up! It wasn't long before it was gone, thankfully. Then came the most alluring, delicious even, sweet floral fragrance. I'm not picking up the berry note that is among the notes listed.  Instead, on my skin I am smelling the divine floral notes. Not long after that, on the dry down I enjoy the experience of the oh-so-yummy warm notes, which typically last for several hours. I think this is a very comforting and very sensual fragrance.

They come in a plastic box which can safely hold your used blades.  I've been very happy with them.  You can get a 100 pack for less than $20 that will last you 1 - 2 years.  Don't waste your time trying to pinch pennies on inferior blades, this is your face you're talking about!

* Extremely sharp, but also smooth shaving
* Coated with chromium, ceramic, and teflon.  In my experience this does deliver a smooth shave
* Comes with plastic boxes for blade disposal.  Many cheaper brands do not.

Even right after a shower and with good shaving cream, I found going against the grain to be quite uncomfortable.  I really needed to pull the razor through the hairs, which is never good.

31091,5.0,2014-03-05,2014,"I give them 5 stars because they're of consistent manufacture. I've tried these out for a while now, off and on, over the last year. The experience I get from these are very consistent from blade to blade. Other blades I've tried occasionally throw a bad blade in. I haven't seen that with these.

Now, about the blade, this is a very mild edged blade. If Feather and Personna Lab are 9.5-10/10 in terms of sharpness, I would rate these somewhere in the neighborhood of Derby. These would rank a 2-3/10. Don't be mislead by that, it speaks nothing to the quality of the blade or the shave. Matter of fact, this is a fine blade. There is a perfect blade and razor combo for every face that is going to vary based on skin and beard type. If you find that Feather are too harsh, try a medium blade, like Astra SP, and if that's also hard on you, give these a whirl. Conversely, if these are chewing your face up, try out Astra SP. They're an excellent quality 6/10 sharpness blade.

Personally, I don't like these blades for my face. Lord, Derby, and the like are just too mild for me. These pull and tug as I shave, a good indication that the blade is too mild. That aside, they are friendly and easy to shave with. In spite of the immediate discomfort, they leave me with smooth, irritation-free shaves, hence I don't mind continuing to test them. And I can use the blade for a week of daily shaves and see little or no change in the performance of the blade.

And just a tip, when trying out a new blade, before passing final judgement, give it a solid week of shaves with a single blade. Even if the first round isn't great, give it a solid week, or 4-7 shaves, to really evaluate the blade fairly. Your first shave might be atrocious, but I've found with some blades that once the first shave or two passes, I get the best shaves I could ask for. Other blades I find I can use for two weeks of daily shaves with good results, which I would not have known if I never evaluated the deterioration of the edge over time. And other blades start out giving me great shaves, but they peter out quickly, leaving me with 3-4 good shaves before I have to change blades. Personally, I'll sacrifice the best shave I can get for a blade that I can change out once a week and still get a great shave with.

31114,5.0,2014-02-05,2014,"I chose this rating because of the overall experience I had while using the Wilkinson Sword DE razor blades. I am a new proponent to wet-shaving and I have been experimenting with different blades, trying to find the best one for my skin/beard type. I have only tried three brands so far: Dorco (Korea) Derby Extra (Turkey) and the Wilkinson Sword (Germany). These blades seem to work very well for me and my skin/beard. I found that the Dorcos gave me an okay shave, considering my experience so far and the Derby's ...well, I didn't care for them much, they seemed to be too dull for my liking but again this is with somewhat junior experience. The Wilkinson sword left my face feeling nice and smooth after two passes and I ended up with no nicks or cuts. As far as longevity, I have not yet put them to the test but for most blades, I have been getting 5-7 shaves. I truly think that the way sharpness feels is personal.

31161,5.0,2013-05-30,2013,"TL;DR  These are good, sharp blades and provide an extremely close shave. Possibly my favorite blade where cost is no concern. Feather is sharper, but doesn't provide a better shave in my experience. Astra SP Platinum is not quite as sharp, but is half as expensive and still quite comfortable.

Here is my review of the blades I've tried. There are a lot of sampler packs on Amazon, but after doing some research I chose to order around 30 each of just a few different blades to try, avoiding all of the lesser-quality ""filler"". I'll compare here and there to Mach-3 blades since that's what I previously used before switching to electric, and now this.

First off, Derby is what came with my razor. These you can practically rake across your face any way you see fit. They aren't very sharp, on par with a Mach-3 that's been used a few times. Shaving requires more strokes which leads to more irritation, especially on the neck. That said, I'd say these are a good blade if you're super worried about cutting yourself, because it's practically impossible. But even beginners might want to look elsewhere as these blades kind of ruin the ""shaving experience"". Don't be disappointed if you just bought this razor and have only tried these blades! Keep reading...

I ordered a 100-pack of Astra SP Platinum (that's Astra Superior Premium Platinum, not the regular stainless) since it's under ten bucks at the time of this writing. These are great. Beginners, start here. They're sharp enough that you don't have to press the razor against your skinwhich you shouldn't have to! You're supposed to let the weight of your razor do the work as you guide it along your face in short strokes. So naturally, these are sharper than Mach-3 blades, but if you do press a little, you probably won't nick yourself. I love these blades because for me, they're comfortable enough for everyday use and provide good, close shaves at a very inexpensive price. Easy on my neck with care. My go-to blade. Great for beginners and pros alike, and eligible for Subscribe & Save!

Wilkinson Sword Classic seem to be great blades for people who have their technique down pretty well. Compared to Astra SP Platinum, they are sharper. They provided the best shave of the lot, but I did nick myself here and there on my neck and below my chin the first time around. Do not push these blades against your skin. It doesn't take much mastery to use these, and they're worth working up to. Downside: more than twice the price of Astra SP Platinum. I'll keep some of these around for days when I want the closest shave possible, or I just feel like something different. If you're new to traditional shaving or think Mach-3 blades are sharp, maybe don't start here, but definitely try them out.

Feather ""New Hi Stainless"" Platinum Coated blades are exactly what the reviews say: sharp. My first shave I got a good amount of nicks, but my second I had almost none. I adapted well, and you have to; each brand is a little different and the best require good technique, but some are more forgiving than others. These are negligibly sharper than the Wilkinson Sword Classic but they aren't forgiving at all and I didn't achieve any better of a shave. They're incredibly sharp compared to a Mach-3 blade. At 2x the price of the aforementioned and more than 3x the price of Astra SP Platinum, I won't be keeping these on hand, but your mileage may vary. If you only want the sharpest blade around, this is it. Fun fact: these come ten to a pack instead of five.

In conclusion, I'm sticking with Astra SP Platinum for regular use and Wilkinson Sword Classic when I'm up for something sharper. I shave every other day, and either is priced reasonably enough that if I want, I can use each side of a blade just once for a fresh edge every shave. That's about a 100-pack every year, so do the maths on price.

The Wilkinson Sword blades gave me a superb shave that reduced what stubble I had into smooth skin. I've also found I can get a close shave with fewer passes and in a shorter amount of time than the Shark Super Chrome blades I had originally used. I have had no nicks or cuts either, which surprised me given how aggressive the blade can be with hair.

I know there are many other types of razor brands out there(I recommend buying a sample pack), but Wilkinson Sword seems to be the perfect match for my needs. If you're lucky enough to have the same experience as I did with these babies then I hope this review helped! Here's that link I promised to those of you who are still unsure:

I've used 4 different brands of blades, and so far, these are definitely the best.  The smoothest, sharpest, etc.

Each blade is individually ""sealed"" by being wrapped in wax paper, etc.  This prevents them from rusting simply due to humidity in the bathroom (which 3 of the 4 other brands i've used did - just sitting in their plastic container waiting).  This makes them smoother, and sharper, for longer.

Pro-tip: if you store your razor in mineral oil between shaves, each blade can last for WEEKS, this can cut down the replacements on these too!

That's because the blades are so close together that hair gets trapped between the blades. They promise you a closer shave and all that, but I haven't seen any difference.

My double edged razor - the same one that my dad and probably his dad used to shave with - gives me a very close shave and I only rinse once and even then I just hold it under water and all the hair is gone. With the Gillettes I used to have to rub it with my fingers to get all the hair off!

Not the least is the feeling of manliness you get when you shave with a double edged razor. Yes, it's not a straight edge, but this is why I like it. It is innovation where they've made a good product (straight edge) better and safer!

31417,5.0,2012-07-19,2012,"Honestly, just toss out all other bubble bath products.  This one is made with lactic acid (excellent for women's skin in particular, if you do your research) and horse chestnut extract along with a fragrance you won't find in any American-made bath product except Vitabath.  (And the original Vitabath Spring Green formula is essentially a more expensive version of this product; and in my opinion inferior.  I use Vitabath Original when I run out of Badedas.)

The quality is top-notch; you don't need to use any soap with this product if you're using it as a bubble bath.  It cleans you.  And it seems to clean the tub as well, because this is the *one* product I have ever used that:

1) Gets you a ""shower-fresh"" clean feeling from a bath (Usually baths relax me, but showers make me feel ""clean"" ...)
2) Requires absolutely no clean up - you're clean and so is your bath tub; no residue to bath tub ring AT ALL
3) Everyone in the family loves; men and women will both appreciate the unisex ""forest/clean"" smell.  It's hard to describe yet you'll never forget it once you smell it.

This isn't something you can just go pick up at the store in the US (usually, unless you live in New York or L.A.) - so Amazon provides an easy way to keep a supply of this on hand.  Buy a bottle for your wife (or, heck - yourself) - you won't regret it.  Also makes a very unique gift - the receiver of said gift, if American, has likely never tried any bath product even close to this.

This stuff is rich, makes masses of long-lasting bubbles and has a soothing, strong herbal smell. I'm a gin drinker and it seems like the perfect bubble bath for someone who loves those potent smells. Nothing relaxes me like a long, hot Badedas bath.

31419,5.0,2012-06-17,2012,"This has a fragrance and consistency identical to that of Vitabath Spring Green, for those familiar with that product. The Badedas version is more fun to own, because the label is in 3 languages (no English, though!) and you'll feel like a beauty maverick making niche discoveries, even though Badedas is as ubiquitous in Germany as Irish Spring is here.  All I can say about this delightful product, which I've repurchased again and again, is that it is in a class by itself. It is so super-concentrated that one teaspoonful on a bath pouf will get you squeaky-clean, as will one tablespoonful (about 1/3 capful) in a full bath. The color is really cool-- it makes the bathwater glow green! But, more important, the fragrance is aromatherapeutic pampering at its best (cool, green, herbal, and piney, but not overly antiseptic or masculine) and the formula delivers a wonderfully refreshed clean feeling. I don't know what the horse chestnut extract does exactly, but I do know that a hot Badedas bath can make up for a long night shift, a rough afternoon with the kids, or just about anything else life can dish out. It restores me down to my soul, and makes me smell wonderful for hours.

My only caveat would be for those with dry or sensitive skin-- this is a highly fragranced, highly detergent product and isn't particularly skin-softening, especially if you are used to Dove or Caress-type body washes with added moisturizers.

This bubble bath version of Badedas was definitely much better and lived up to my expectations.  The scent was a little stronger --- fragrant, but not overpowering.

It was simply perfect and I have been using it ever since as a body wash -- I've found that very small amounts are sufficient for use as a body wash and still have not gone through a bottle in almost two months.

31456,1.0,2009-02-15,2009,"Update 3/7/15-- The formula for Badedas has been changed by Unilever, and I no longer recommend this product. Several significant ingredients have been omitted, the pine scent is gone, the consistency is thinner, and the experience like an ordinary bubble bath. Save your money, this is not the original German formula Badedas many people used and loved for decades...

Original review from 2009: ""It's Good To Be Bad""  I was introduced to Badedas bubble bath about 30 years ago by my sister, who said the stuff had near-magical properties (it does). She said it's full of unusual botanicals (true), makes tons of long-lasting bubbles (yup), smells incredibly good (oh yeah), and leaves the tub sparkling clean (also true).  The cost back then was around $1 an ounce.

  I've become mostly a shower-taker, but recently, when my 20-year-old bottle of Bededas turned up empty, I decided to revisit the stuff.  Remembering my sister's warning that the ""Vita-Bath"" products are an American copy of Bededas without all the great botanicals, I was looking for the genuine article.  Lo and behold, I found it on Amazon, of course, from several dealers at various price-points.  Smallflower (aka Merz Apothecary of Chicago) seems like a reputable dealer, selling the real deal, and even with somewhat exorbitant shipping, the price is now LESS than $1 an ounce.  Pretty good for 30 years.  Shipping was quite fast, by the way, and the product arrived UPS on the sixth calendar day after ordering.

  This Badedas (now owned by Sara Lee!) is apparently the original formula, made in Germany, with the horse chestnut oil that helps make it so magical. It also contains limonene, a very citrus-scented hydrocarbon derived from plants, and linalool, a more floral-spicy scented chemical found in over 200 species of plant.  Not the kind of stuff you'd find in your average drugstore bubble bath.  The overall scent is somewhat pine-y, and incredibly fresh and pleasant.

  A small amount of Badedas added to running hot water makes a lot of luxurious bubbles.  The overall sensation is one of slight skin-softening without the oiliness you get with some products.  Also, a slight sense of skin-tightening, but this is somewhat subjective. USE NO SOAP in a Badedas bath-- you don't need any.  Just a washcloth or sponge, and you leave the bath feeling quite clean.  Badedas seems to absorb dirt and body oils and odors into solution, and it all goes down the drain, leaving you, and your bathtub, quite clean.  Remarkable stuff.

  If you ever take a bath for relaxation, or even a wash-up, I'd highly recommend Badedas.  Smallflower has an excellent price on this 25.5 ounce size, and if you take one bath a week, this bottle should last you at least two years!  Badedas is a wonderful luxury bath product, and would make a terrific gift for a bubble bath fan, or even yourself and/or your mate.","Badedas Classic Vital Bad Bubble Bath, 25.5 Fluid Ounce",Badedas,Update The formula for Badedas has been changed by Unilever and I no longer recommend this product Several significant ingredients have been omitted the pine scent is gone the consistency is thinner and the experience like an ordinary bubble bath Save your money this is not the original German formula Badedas many people used and loved for decades Original review from It s Good To Be Bad I was introduced to Badedas bubble bath about years ago by my sister who said the stuff had near magical properties it does She said it s full of unusual botanicals true makes tons of long lasting bubbles yup smells incredibly good oh yeah and leaves the tub sparkling clean also true The cost back then was around an ounce I ve become mostly a shower taker but recently when my year old bottle of Bededas turned up empty I decided to revisit the stuff Remembering my sister s warning that the Vita Bath products are an American copy of Bededas without all the great botanicals I was looking for the genuine article Lo and behold I found it on Amazon of course from several dealers at various price points Smallflower aka Merz Apothecary of Chicago seems like a reputable dealer selling the real deal and even with somewhat exorbitant shipping the price is now LESS than an ounce Pretty good for years Shipping was quite fast by the way and the product arrived UPS on the sixth calendar day after ordering This Badedas now owned by Sara Lee is apparently the original formula made in Germany with the horse chestnut oil that helps make it so magical It also contains limonene a very citrus scented hydrocarbon derived from plants and linalool a more floral spicy scented chemical found in over species of plant Not the kind of stuff you d find in your average drugstore bubble bath The overall scent is somewhat pine y and incredibly fresh and pleasant A small amount of Badedas added to running hot water makes a lot of luxurious bubbles The overall sensation is one of slight skin softening without the oiliness you get with some products Also a slight sense of skin tightening but this is somewhat subjective USE NO SOAP in a Badedas bath you don t need any Just a washcloth or sponge and you leave the bath feeling quite clean Badedas seems to absorb dirt and body oils and odors into solution and it all goes down the drain leaving you and your bathtub quite clean Remarkable stuff If you ever take a bath for relaxation or even a wash up I d highly recommend Badedas Smallflower has an excellent price on this ounce size and if you take one bath a week this bottle should last you at least two years Badedas is a wonderful luxury bath product and would make a terrific gift for a bubble bath fan or even yourself and or your mate ,0.9965,Positive,0.18,0.14,0.16,0.25,0.27,Fear

I have used it with multi-blade cartridges, where all you have to do is rub it on your face with your fingers, and it works great. I currently use it with a double-edge safety razor, but because of the single blade one is using, it is better to use a brush to get it on; a bowl is not necessary, just put a dime-size amount on the brush and make circles on your face to make it lather.

Finally, it is only sold in stores in Germany, Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands Spain, and possibly others. I have no idea why is isn't sold in countries like the US, UK, Italy, etc. But the Amazon price is pretty darn close to the price in these countries, and it is much easier than driving into Canada to buy it, unless you're in Buffalo or Detroit.  :^)

I would like to start by saying that the soap does smell amazing and my body smells great after my shower and my skin feels very soft.

However, we just received the soap on Tuesday and it's now Friday evening (used Wed, Thurs and Friday) and I have posted pictures of what is left of the soap. I really expected at $8 a bar it would last 2 people, showering once a day each, more than it has.  I do keep the soap in a soap dish with holes so it's not sitting in water when it's in the dish, and it's also at the back of the shower so the shower head doesn't spray near it.

Also the dark top edge fell off, so in my picture you can see where we've just pressed it back on to the bar of soap.

I think I could have given it 4 stars if it weren't for me already using another frankincense & myrrh soap from another company that also smells great, leaves my skin soft, but it's cheaper for an ounce more and lasts quite a bit longer (it's also 100% natural).","ZUM Zum Bar Anise Lavender, 3 Ounce",ZUM,I had very high hopes for this particular soap seeing as the ratings were really high Unfortunately my experience hasn t been as great as what others have posted I would like to start by saying that the soap does smell amazing and my body smells great after my shower and my skin feels very soft However we just received the soap on Tuesday and it s now Friday evening used Wed Thurs and Friday and I have posted pictures of what is left of the soap I really expected at a bar it would last people showering once a day each more than it has I do keep the soap in a soap dish with holes so it s not sitting in water when it s in the dish and it s also at the back of the shower so the shower head doesn t spray near it Also the dark top edge fell off so in my picture you can see where we ve just pressed it back on to the bar of soap I think I could have given it stars if it weren t for me already using another frankincense myrrh soap from another company that also smells great leaves my skin soft but it s cheaper for an ounce more and lasts quite a bit longer it s also natural ,-0.1756,Neutral,0.22,0.04,0.13,0.3,0.3,Sad
